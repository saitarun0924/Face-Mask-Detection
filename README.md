# Face-Mask-Detection

Face Mask Detection using only Open CV

*** Make sure you download and use the XML files in "resources" folder ***

Main Task of the project is to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not with live webcam, where we use Open CV module and Cascade files to recognize face.
1.  If he did not wear any Mask then a message will appear in Red color showing that " Please wear mask! "
2.  If he wear Mask then a message will appear in Green color showing that " Good Job! "
3.  If the Face is not detected then a message will appear in Green color showing that " No face found..."
